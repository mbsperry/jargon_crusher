Caution comes first 

A final word (I hope) on the bike versus motorized vehicle issue. I
rode a bicycle to the exclusion of all other vehicles for more than
30 years, and I am here to tell about it in part because I always
exercised extreme caution. When I was stopped and there was a
vehicle next to me, I either made eye contact with the driver or
waited for the vehicle to start before I proceeded. And there
were a number of times that the vehicle turned right in front of
me. 

The moral is that just because you have the right of way doesn't
always mean you should take it.
