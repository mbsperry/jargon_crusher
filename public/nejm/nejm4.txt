Systematic and thorough fluoroscopic examination provides essential diagnostic information in patients with unilateral or bilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction. The physician can substantially improve patient comfort and cooperation by describing the examination, differentiating predominantly diaphragmatic breathing from chest-wall breathing, and providing verbal reassurance.1 Initially, each hemidiaphragm is observed during quiet breathing. While the patient stands on the fluoroscopy-table footplate, hemidiaphragmatic movement is observed during inspiration (slow, rapid, or both) from residual volume to total lung capacity in the anterior–posterior, oblique, and lateral projections. Most important, these maneuvers are repeated in the supine position. The restrictive function becomes more severe when the patient is in the supine position, as noted in the review by McCool and Tzelepis (March 8 issue).2 Hemidiaphragmatic excursion (or paradox) can be measured in centimeters or posterior intercostal spaces between fixed horizontal fluoroscopic cones.1
Normal movement of each hemidiaphragm may be readily distinguished from variations of normal movement, as well as from weakness and paralysis. Meticulous fluoroscopic examination supplants the limited “sniff test” at the cost of a few minutes and can be the first best test. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with sagittal and coronal reformatting, CT fluoroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging may have a future role in evaluation of the diaphragm.
