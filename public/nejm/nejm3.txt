We thank Hiniker and colleagues for their letter referencing our report, which described a patient with melanoma who had an impressive systemic antitumor response after local radiotherapy. We are encouraged to hear of their patient who had a complete response to radiotherapy and ipilimumab, though we acknowledge that it is possible that their patient's complete response could have been due to ipilimumab alone.
We have now identified another patient with melanoma treated with ipilimumab whom we believe had an abscopal effect after radiotherapy. His disease slowly progressed after more than 2 years of stability while he received maintenance ipilimumab. A total dose of 27 Gy of radiotherapy was administered in three fractions to an enlarging internal mammary lymph node, and regression of distant, nonirradiated, and previously progressing left axillary lymphadenopathy occurred.
These anecdotal cases support preclinical observations that show synergy between CTLA-4 blockade and radiotherapy.1,2 We are enthusiastically collaborating with Stanford University and encourage participation in the clinical trial to test this hypothesis prospectively. Correlative immunologic analyses of peripheral blood and tumor tissue will be essential to advancing a mechanistic understanding of this potentially promising combination.
