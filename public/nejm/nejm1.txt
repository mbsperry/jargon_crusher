Harrison et al. (March 1 issue)1 report findings of the Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK Inhibitor Treatment II (COMFORT-II) that may herald a new era in treating myelofibrosis. At week 48, 30% of patients in the ruxolitinib group had progression events, as compared with 26% in the group receiving the best available therapy. How do the authors account for the lack of an advantage of ruxolitinib with respect to progression events? Interestingly, some patients had a response to ruxolitinib, although they did not carry the mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase (JAK) 2 (JAK2 V617F). What is the molecular mechanism in that case? Ruxolitinib is not a specific inhibitor of JAK2, since it also down-regulates JAK1.1 However, these mutations are not connected with a common ancestral clone, but instead are regarded as secondary genetic events without disease specificity.2 Targeting of JAK1 has been considered pathogenetically unnecessary and potentially harmful, whereas nonspecific JAKâ€“signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibition possibly aims at cytokine inflammatory activity and nonselective tumor debulking, providing transient benefit.2 Moreover, Harrison and colleagues do not report the possible reduction of the JAK2 V617F allele burden after treatment. Finally, why was the randomization ratio 2:1 instead of 1:1? Why did very few patients remain in the group receiving best available therapy?
