The results of the COMFORT-I trial reported by Verstovsek et al.,1 the results of the COMFORT-II trial, and the related editorial by Tefferi2 indicate that the ideal subpopulation of patients with myelofibrosis for administration of ruxolitinib would have “hyperproliferative bone marrow with fibrosis and splenomegaly.”3 It is possible that ruxolitinib will be harmful for many patients with end-stage myelofibrosis by worsening anemia- and thrombocytopenia-associated symptoms and increasing transfusion requirements, without any positive effects on marrow histopathology, cytogenetics, molecular lesions, splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and survival. Bone marrow cellular production should be capable of compensating for the antiproliferative effects of JAK–STAT inhibitors in patients with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib may be more effective early in the natural history of the disease than late in the disease course.
